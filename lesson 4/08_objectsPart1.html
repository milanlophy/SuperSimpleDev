        An object is just an another type of value . It groups multiple values together. It can have properties (property-value pairs) and methods .  We can have many property-value pairs in an object which are separated using comma. <p></p>

        Here name, price are properties. And socks, 450 are values . Using property we can access or change specific values in object by using dot notation or bracket notation. <p></p> 

        Bracket notation can be used for adding value to the object besides accessing and changing. Inside brackets we can use strings, variables, calculations or anything that results in a value. <p></p>

        We usually use dot notation by default. ***For properties that don't work with dot operator, use bracket notation.

        <p>Syntax :</p>
        
        objName = {     <p></p>
            property : value,       <p></p>
            ...         <p></p>
        }

        <p>Why we use objects ?</p>
        Objects make our code more organized. We group all related values together in an object. It enables us to to group multiple values together and also use multiple values together.
