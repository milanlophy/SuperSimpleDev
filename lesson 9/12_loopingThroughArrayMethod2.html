        <title>Lesson 12 : Looping through Array Method 2</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        We loop through an array using for loop or a while loop. Another way is by using the method forEach() which is the preferred way to loop through an array. Because this is easier to read than a for loop and while loop.
        <p>forEach() has a feature : the function can have 2 parameters , value and index (gives position of value in the array)</p>

            [
                'make dinner',
                'wash dishes',
                'watch youTube'
            ].forEach(function(value, index){
                console.log(index , value)
            })  // forEach fn loop through the array and store each value of array in value parameter and run the function
