        setTimeout() is a built-in-function that allows us to run a function in the future. It takes 2 parameters : <p></p>
        
        * fn we want to run in the future <p></p> * timer in millisecond (1000 ms = 1 sec)

        <p>Asynchronous code : Computer won't wait for a line to finish before going to next line. Doesn't block program running</p>
        <p>Synchronous code : Code runs line by line. Computer waits for one line to complete. It blocks the code until one line is finished</p>

        <p>setInterval() is also a built-in-function. It also takes the same 2 parameters as setTimeout()</p>
